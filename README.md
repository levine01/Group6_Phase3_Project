## Introduction
GNB Bank is a leading financial institution, providing various banking and financial services to its customers. As with any bank, customer retention is crucial for maintaining a strong market presence and sustaining profitability. Identifying customers who are likely to churn is of paramount importance for GNB Bank to implement targeted strategies and retain valuable customers. In this bprojec, we will explore a dataset containing customer information, including demographics, banking behavior, and historical churn data. Our objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict customer churn and provide valuable insights to help GNB Bank enhance its customer retention efforts.

## Business Understanding
For GNB Bank, understanding and predicting customer churn is critical for several reasons. First and foremost, customer churn impacts the bank's revenue and profitability. Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones, so preventing churn can lead to significant cost savings. Moreover, customer retention contributes to a positive reputation and strengthens the bank's position in the highly competitive financial industry. By leveraging machine learning techniques to predict customer churn, GNB Bank can proactively address the needs of at-risk customers, personalize their banking experience, and develop targeted marketing campaigns to foster long-term customer loyalty.
